# Composable token

When we creating dapps or especially game on blockchain, we are getting familiar with non-fungible tokens like pet, hero, monster...

Everything work well until we decide to create items system.

Those also are nft tokens (sometimes are fungible-tokens), and will be attached to hero in game for strength increment.

The nightmare begin when we try to attach many items to a hero, likes sword, helmet, gloves, boosts... and with each items it may also has many other items attach on it, and of course, those can be any nft or ft token, also.

So if we use nft standalone, the attachment and detachment, transfering items will become painful when the items system become complex with so many transactions required. The game performance may be broken.

This is the motivation to creating a new type of token - a composable-token, where any nft token can be attached to or deteach from any nft token at any time. Thus we can easily, automatically transfer whole heros along with all attached items in one transactions, or we can detach any items before send thoses.
